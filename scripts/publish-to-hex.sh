#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Is this checkout ready to be released? Runs every guard the release runs,
# builds the package and the docs, and dry-runs the publish.
#
# IT DOES NOT PUBLISH, AND THAT IS THE POINT. It used to, and it was worse
# than macula's was: it ran `rebar3 compile', `rebar3 eunit', `rebar3 ex_doc'
# and then `rebar3 hex publish', with NO tag check and NO clean-tree check of
# any kind. `rebar3 hex publish' packages the WORKING TREE, not a tag, so it
# would happily publish a dirty checkout of an arbitrary commit under whatever
# version src/reckon_gater.app.src happened to name.
#
# The release path is .github/workflows/publish-hex.yml, armed by pushing the
# tag. Its verify job repeats these checks on a clean runner, and its publish
# job then WAITS in the `hex-publish' environment for a required reviewer
# before anything is sent. A gate is only worth as much as the absence of a
# way around it, and a script on a maintainer's machine that publishes without
# that reviewer is a way around it: two paths to one version, one of them
# unreviewed. That mattered especially here, because reckon-gater's gate is new and
# has never been exercised, so its first real test is a release.
#
# So this is now the local half of that workflow: everything up to, and
# including, the dry run. Run it before pushing a tag, to find out on your own
# machine what would otherwise fail in CI after the tag exists. A tag can be
# deleted and recut; a publish cannot be unpublished.
#
# Usage: scripts/publish-to-hex.sh   (from a clean checkout of the release tag)

==> reckon-gater ${GATER_VERSION} is ready to release. Nothing was published.

To release it:
  git push origin v${GATER_VERSION}

That arms .github/workflows/publish-hex.yml. Its publish job waits for its
required reviewer; approving that run is what publishes.

Afterwards, to check hex serves the tagged code rather than assuming it:
  scripts/is_hex_serving_what_git_says.sh ${GATER_VERSION}
EOF
